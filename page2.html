                        <p>
                            Today roughly 3,000 catadores work on the landfill (although only 1,752 are officially
                            registered) removing 200 tons of recyclable materials each day. They have extended the life
                            of
                            the landfill by removing materials that would have otherwise been buried and have
                            contributed to
                            the landfill having one of the highest recycling rates in the world.
